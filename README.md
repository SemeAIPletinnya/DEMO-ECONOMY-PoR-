# How the PoR Equity Model Works
*(and why 22% liquidity still means 100% control)*

This project does not treat ownership and control as the same thing.

In Proof-of-Resonance (PoR), control is not a percentage —
it is a function of coherence, architecture, and signal origin.

## Distribution Overview

### 51% — Founder Phase Anchor (Non-Liquid)

This portion is not for sale, not for trading, and not for governance voting.

It represents the central coherence source of the system.

PoR-based systems require:

- a single origin of semantic frequency,
- a stable reference for coherence metrics,
- and an immutable decision authority over control-layer logic.

This is structural, not financial ownership.
Removing or diluting this anchor breaks system coherence.

### 21% — Investors

Capital allocated strictly for scaling, not direction.

Investors:

- do not influence model behavior,
- do not alter PoR metrics,
- do not participate in control-layer decisions.

Capital expands capacity.
It does not define frequency.

### 12% — Core Team (12 contributors)

Distributed to engineers and researchers contributing to:

- PoR metrics
- kernel implementations
- validation infrastructure
- simulations and tooling

The team contributes resonance, not authority.

### 10% — Community Pool

Allocated to:

- open-source contributors,
- ecosystem growth,
- external experimentation,
- long-term adoption incentives.

This pool increases surface area — not control.

### 6% — Network Stability Pool

Reserved for:

- PoR simulations,
- validators,
- infrastructure stability,
- long-horizon system health.

This pool exists to measure and preserve stability, not to vote on it.

## Why 22% Liquidity Still Equals Full Control

Because in PoR:

- control does not come from capital concentration,
- it comes from architectural authorship.

I designed:

- the PoR metrics,
- the kernel logic,
- the coherence thresholds,
- the Silence-as-Control primitive,
- and the system-level decision boundaries.

These are not governance parameters —
they are control-layer constraints.

You cannot vote to remove coherence requirements.
You cannot outvote semantic collapse.
You cannot scale direction without the frequency source.

## Control as Coherence, Not Ownership

Traditional systems assume:

- more shares → more control

PoR systems assume:

- more coherence → more authority

That is why:

- the founder retains 100% directional control
- even with distributed ownership
- even with open-source participation
- even with external capital

Because coherence cannot be forked by vote.

## Final Note

This model is intentionally resistant to:

- hostile takeovers,
- governance drift,
- incentive misalignment,
- and capital-driven control inversion.

It is designed so that:

> The system would rather fall silent than obey incoherent authority.

That is not a business constraint.
It is a control-layer guarantee.
